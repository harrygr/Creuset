# Creuset

Creuset is a powerful cms and blogging platform built in Laravel. It is intended to use design patterns and have a structure that allows it to be flexible to the extent it could be easily extented or adapted, for example, be turned into an ecommerce solution.

## Features

- Testing using PHPUnit and [laracasts/integrated][1].
- Extensible taxonomies; currently used for _categories_ and _tags_ but can be expanded to others.
- Repository design pattern for retrieving data.
- EAV design pattern for allowing unlimited attributes to be applied to models (coming soon)

## Contributing

This app was started partly as a teaching exercise, but the aim is to make something usable nonetheless. I you want to contribute feel free to submit pull a pull request or offer suggestions in the issues section.
